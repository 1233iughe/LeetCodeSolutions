'''
Algorithm (dynamic array and arrays):
1. Select a special character as spacer.
2. Loop throught each element of the list and add them to a string with the following format
nÂ° of characters+separator+element
3. To decode check if element[i] is equal to separator 
    3.1 if it is stablish the end of the word by checking a[i-1] and add the value to i + 1 (j)
    3.2 Extract the charcter of the word by copying all elements from the string in the range a[i+1:j]
    3.3 Append to the output list
    3.4 Set i = j
    3.6 If not equal to separator add 1 to i
Encode:
n -> length of list
w -> length of average word
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n*(w+1+digits in number of characters))-> O(n*w)
Decode:
s_> length of string
Time: O(2/3s) -> O(s)
Space: O(n)

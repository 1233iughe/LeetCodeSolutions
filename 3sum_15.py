'''
The problem is a slightly more complicated version of the 2 sum problem.
Original: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Complement to 0: [1,0,-1,-2,1,4]
For every num check if any other 2 two nums add to its complement:
Complements for complement of -1: [None,1,0,2,5]
Complements for complement of 0: [1,None,-1,2,1,4]
Complements for complement of 1: [0,-1,None,-3,0,3]
Complements for complement of 2: [-3,-2,-1,None,-3,2]
Complements for complement of -1: [0,1,0,None,5]
Complements for complement of -4: [5,-4,-6,-3,5,None]
        
Algorithm (Time: O(nÂ²), Space O(n))
1. Sort the array
2. Loop throught the array checking if there are 2 num that add up 
to the complement.
3. If the next number is not equal to the current number set to pointers i+1 and len(array)-1
    3.1 If they add over the target decrease right by 1 
    3.2 If they add under the target increase left by 1
    3.3 If they cross break the loop
    3.4 If i == i+1 move to i+2 to avoid duplicates
